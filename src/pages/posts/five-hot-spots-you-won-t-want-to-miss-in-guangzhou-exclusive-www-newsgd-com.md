To short on time and money to travel, and looking for something to brighten up your life in Guangzhou?



**To short on time and money to travel, and looking for something to brighten up your life in Guangzhou?**

Here are five hot spots for you visit in Guangzhou, to brighten up your commute, to give you a hit of adrenaline, to bring China’s past to life, and to let you unwind after a long week at work working the 9-9-6 grind!

**China’s most beautiful metro station**

Last April, Nansha Passenger Port station and the Guangdong Times Museum ‘Art on Track’ project were selected as 'the most beautiful metro station in China'. Guangzhou also features a stunning riverside tram route, have you taken it yet?

The following two locations should be on everyone's must-visit list.

*Nansha Passenger Port station (South extension of Line 4)*

The ocean, ships, seagulls.... the whole station is decorated on a maritime theme, symbolising Guangzhou’s role as the starting point of the ancient Maritime Silk Road.

*Guangzhou Tram*

The current tram route is regarded as the most beautiful public transport route in Guangzhou. Out of the tram window, you have a fantastic view of Huacheng Square, Liede Bridge and as well as city icons, such as the Canton tower, Pazhou Pagoda, Guangzhou Exhibition Park, Zhujiang and the Party Pier Beer Culture & Art Zone.

**Baiyun Zip Line**

The zip line connects the Moxing Peak of Baiyun Mountain with the Huangpodong Reservoir. The longest zip line in China, it takes one hour to walk the whole route through the mountains, however, only two minutes by zip line. Hurtling on the zip line you will reach a maximum speed of more than 120 kilometers per hour, with a drop more than 200 meters. Definitely one for adrenaline junkies!

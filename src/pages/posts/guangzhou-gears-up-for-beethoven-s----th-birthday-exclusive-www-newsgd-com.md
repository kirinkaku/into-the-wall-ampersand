At Guangzhou’s Opera House, you won’t want to miss out on a chance to see Beethoven's only opera ‘Fidelio’, a masterpiece celebrating love and freedom, which will be brought to the stage by over 200 performers from Beethoven's birthplace, the German city of Bonn. Renowned Russian pianist Boris Berezovsky will perform all Beethoven's piano concertos, and the Shanghai Quartet, Artis-Quartet Wien and Brodsky Quartet will interpret Beethoven's complete string quartets.

Beethoven is arguably history’s greatest composer of symphonies. According to the Statistics of Classical Music in 2018 released by classical music website Bachtrack, Beethoven leads the top 10 most popular composers, followed by Mozart and Bernstein. Beethoven lived in Bonn for the first two decades of his life. The German pianist later settled in Vienna Europe’s capital of music at the time, where he died in 1827.

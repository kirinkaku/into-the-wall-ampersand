Guangdong-Macao Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Technology Industrial Park Development recently became one of the first 17 National TCM Service Export Bases that promote the inheritance, innovation, and popularity of the treatments.

The bases were selected by the Ministry of Commerce and National Administration of TCM from more than 300 hospitals, universities, and large enterprises through examination, expert review, presentation, and comprehensive appraisal. They all foster high-quality development of the TCM service trade.
